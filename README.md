Atlee Community Church Podcast Manager

This is a piece of software intended to handle deployment and distribution of video files to multiple sites.  Initially
it will only handle iTunes and YouTube, but the intent is to expand this via plugins to cover additional sites.  Along
with this it will also hopefully expand out to cover notification style postings on Facebook, G+, Twitter, etc.

Please see INSTALL.md for more information on installation.
